## Date

YYYY-MM-dd

## Context

Our system is built on top of Sant Cugat technical stack which has capabilities that are best leveraged by Java tech stack. We have decided to use Java tech stack for our system.

## Decision

We have decided to use Java tech stack because it provides us with the best tools and libraries to leverage Sant Cugat technical stack capabilities. This allows us to build a system that is optimized for our needs.
